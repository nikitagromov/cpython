Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------
Please read the `devguide <https://cpython-devguide.readthedocs.io/>`_ for
guidance on how to contribute to this project. The documentation covers
everything from how to build the code to submitting a pull request. There are
also suggestions on how you can most effectively help the project.

Please be aware that our workflow does deviate slightly from the typical GitHub
project. Details on how to properly submit a pull request are covered in
`Lifecycle of a Pull Request <https://cpython-devguide.readthedocs.io/pullrequest.html>`_.
One key point is to keep comments on GitHub to only those related to the reviewing
the code in the pull request. All other discussions -- e.g. about the issue being
fixed -- should happen on bugs.python.org.

If you are making a code contribution or large documentation contribution,
please feel free to add yourself to the ``Misc/ACKS`` file alphabetically.


Code of Conduct
---------------
All interactions for this project are covered by the
`PSF Code of Conduct <https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/>`_. Everyone is
expected to be open, considerate, and respectful of others no matter their
position within the project.
